# 📊 Online Retail Data Visualization Project

This project presents a series of visualizations created using the **Online Retail** dataset, showcasing exploratory data analysis and insights into customer purchasing behavior. These visuals were developed as part of a **Data Visualization Certification** program offered by **DataCamp**.

## 📝 Project Description

The *Online Retail* dataset is a real-world transactional dataset containing all the purchases made between 2010 and 2011 for a UK-based online retail store. The data includes customer ID, country, invoice date, product details, quantity, and unit price. 

The goal of this project was to create meaningful visual representations to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data. Each visual contributes to understanding key business metrics such as sales volume, customer segmentation, and regional performance.

## 📈 Visualizations

Four key visuals were developed using this dataset:

1. **Customer Frequency and Revenue Contribution**  
   Highlights the Pareto principle in customer spending behavior—showing how a small percentage of customers contribute to the majority of revenue.

2. **Monthly Sales Trends**  
   Illustrates seasonal trends and fluctuations in sales over time, aiding in identifying peak purchasing months.

3. **Top 10 Countries by Revenue**  
   A bar chart comparing international revenue generation, pinpointing the most lucrative geographic segments.

4. **Product-Level Analysis**  
   Focuses on the highest-selling products and their revenue contribution, useful for inventory and marketing decisions.

*Visuals are included in the `/images` directory.*
